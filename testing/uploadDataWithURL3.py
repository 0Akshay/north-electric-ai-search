Usage Tips to Manage High Bills: Encourage customers to turn off unused devices, unplug electronics on standby, schedule high-energy tasks during off-peak hours, and optimize thermostat and water heater settings.\n\n5. Smart Technology: Use smart plugs and home energy monitoring devices available via North Electric to control and track electricity use effectively.\n\n6. Contact Support: Customers with persistent or unexplained high bills can contact North Electric support through the helpline at 1800-XXX-XXXX or live chat for assistance and dispute resolution.\n\n7. Preventive Measures: Promote behavioral changes such as reducing peak hour usage, taking shorter showers to reduce water heating costs, and regular maintenance of appliances to avoid excess energy consumption.\n\nSLA: High bill inquiries acknowledged within 4 hours and resolved or clarified within 5 business days where possible.",
